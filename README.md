# Fuel-Rod-Prop
An airsoft in game prop styled like a fuel rod.

This prop has 6 different modes of operation depending on what fits the game play best.

It responds to shock and beeps or displays different colored lighting. 

It can be used with the BoomBox prop as well to simulate fuel loading or unloading, if a multi-step goal is required for a game scenario.

The prop has no visible switches – the main power switch is a pushbutton that requires a 1-2”
pin to depress (thru a hole on the end). The unit senses shock and is programmed by
“tapping” it during program mode. Other magnetic sensors are used to “charge” the fuel or
discharge the fuel, and if the charging base isn't handy any high strength magnet can be used
to trip the internal reed switches. By using hidden magnetic switches, the unit is more rugged,
tamper-proof, and weather resistant. 

Note that this will probably not be improved upon or built (by me at least) again, but as i used several resources from others across the net when designing and constructing the device, i wanted to share the results with everyone as well.
